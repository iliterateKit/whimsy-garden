A common icebreaker tossed around asks about your favorite color. As an incredibly indecisive person, I struggle tremendously with this question. 

What do I answer? 

Do I go with orange? Lavender? Two colors that resonate with me deeply, one that reminds of foxes and one of flowers I so dearly enjoy. Do I go with blue or green, simply because my wardrobe has settled into an overwhelmingly blue-green dominant palette? Or do I go with the brilliant bluish-green keppel, a color I fell in love with when I was browsing a Wikipedia article on shades of cyan[^1], a color I fell in love with because it pleased my mouth to roll it around like an Icebreaker coolly melting on my tongue[^2]?

Well, picking favorites is stupid, I say, and not just because I have a hard time with it. 

My favorite color isn't something that can be defined by a vague categorical word ~~or even by something as seemingly specific as a hex code~~. I can't just pick a random hex code, because I don't see the world in hexadecimal! My favorite color has to be one I've seen before, it has to be a color I've experienced personally.

Even if I could just choose one, my favorite color would be tied to a specific moment, a specific memory. How could I begin to capture ~~the entire world as it was when~~ the moment I fell in love in just a single word, in just a single *name*? I'm not nearly a good enough writer for that.

So here, while I'm still thinking about it, let me give you the stories behind some of my favorite hues, with an occasional picture.

My favorite orange[^3] happened on March 19th, 2023, around 6:30 AM. It's the lush color of sunrise I saw at the campsite I was at, an orange brilliantly reflected on the 

The world was on fire that morning, as if the Spanish moss hanging from the branches nearby were the braided locks of a dwarf's beard mid-laugh.

As if a picture can begin to share this color, here you go, a picture of the dwarves' beard:

That trip gave me another favorite color-- my favorite brown. It's from a picture I took, a picture I took trying to take a selfie on my Canon 7D as I ran through the woods. It's

My favorite green is the green that naps//dozes//(some word that conveys posing with power and magnetism) on the leaves after the rain has poured whenever I visit India. It's a rich green, a green that fights the concrete jungles surrounding it. The trees there split the roads, it's nature's rule when you leave the highway. Trees are where roads meet, where roads start, where roads end; 

My favorite pinkish-red is from the shaky, out-of-focus pictures I took with my phone camera the night of May 10th, 2024. A trip with former friends, back when solar phenomena were popping up everywhere you could imagine. We went aurora chasing after we saw a pink glow lingering in the sky past sunset, hopping into a car the minute we finished microwaving dino nuggets for the road. We drove to the nearest darkest site we knew of, our red car a flash of muted color on the highway as we desperately chased the setting skies. Parking at the base of Arabia mountain, we ignored the park closed signs that we couldn't read in the dark and climbed, practically ran, up the mountain, and sat at the top, winded, in the light breeze, trying to catch the final breath of solar beauty before it disappeared for the night.

We saw nothing, of course, nothing with our eyes; we'd lost sight of the aurora long before our drive had ended. But it was the journey that made it special. I hadn't dressed properly for the cold, my 7D didn't have IBIS and my shivering knees were hardly a replacement for a tripod so my pictures were a hot mess. I pulled out my phone to take *something* at least to capture the moment, holding my phone level was a lot easier after all. 

That pink I never managed to see is still softly seared in my mind. For now, until a newer pink takes its place.

My favorite blue is from the Georgia Aquarium

My favorite grey is the sight of a MAERSK container

My favorite black[^4] is the starry night sky on January __ 2022

I guess there isn't a point to this ramble. I'm just practicing my words. But I do think it's a fun exercise to sit down and think about your favorite color. I think my main takeaway has been that

If someone ever asks you about your favorite color, don't just answer what, but also from when.

[^1]: I was pretty sure I was browsing this page because I was musing about the color distribution of my clothes & trying to pick a favorite color. But then I went to find the page again to get a clearer look at keppel and realized I really truly do not remember why I was on it. It is a lovely corner of Wikipedia though.

[^2]: This is a construction I find myself using a lot in my writing. Something about imagining the taste (really the texture) of words in my mouth as I say them is interesting; I'll be writing about this at some point.

[^3]: Yes, it's the orange of sunrise that one morning, not the amber promised in the future of the unripe mangos I've just picked from our garden's tree in India, although that was certainly a close second because of its cloyingly sweet homegrown taste; not the color of the Great Smoky Mountains in autumn, even if they were like a fire in their own way, because it wasn't just the orange that made the moment special then, it was the flamboyant reds and golden yellows too; not the orange of the pumpkin I carved last fall when visiting a friend in Jersey, not even the way it weakly lit up from within its belly when we put a Diwali candle inside; and no, not even the ruff-ish orange of the deer I locked eyes & conversed with on a walk at Roosevelt Island last autumn, because that was less about the color of the moment than it was a connection with nature.

[^4]: This was a tough one, because there are so many moments with black that mean special emotions to me! The eclipse, the Great American Eclipse of 2017, where my family and I drove up to South Carolina with telescope in tow to catch the eclipse in totality was a magical experience; the world went dark for a minute and I was chilled to my core! And going even further back in my memories, there's the overpowering smell of bitumen and plastic melting together in my mind from when we made a little segment of poly-road for the Muktangan Exploratory centre's inter-school science fair; the bitumen sparkled like little black gems as we broke it down with a hammer to prepare it for melting, it
