To write is scary.

To write for an *audience* is even scarier.

This blog is an attempt to practice sharing my writing. It'll be structured as a series of posts ranging from anecdote to article to both, about whatever topic catches my mind. My one rule for myself is that I don't think too hard about what I'm writing, because the more I think about it, the less likely I am to actually finish writing it.

Starting a habit is the hardest part. Posting will be-- especially towards the start-- erratic at best. But here is where this digital garden of mine begins. I hope you stick around to see it grow!
